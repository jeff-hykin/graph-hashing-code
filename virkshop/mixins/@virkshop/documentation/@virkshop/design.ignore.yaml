# To-implement
- create/design the API for
    - marking env vars to be passed along
    - appending to env vars
    - appending to the front of env vars
    - replacing env vars
    - have all of the env vars be written/read to/from a JSON file with each API action
    - injecting/wrapping commands like sudo, generate the code dynamically, then add them to the commands folder of the current package
    - sourcing a file and detecting ENV changes from that

# To-Design:
