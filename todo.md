# pre-alpha:
- have home folder generated, and treated differently
- DONE: have .zshrc source a generated file
- allow loading advanced nix code
- DONE: stop bash from loading a profile (--norc --noprofile)
- linkRealHomeFor()
- pad out numbers and auto-rename them
- get git ignore to work
- purge/clean event
- clear out the dead code

# beta
- cli "virkshop/install [package name]"
- add basic documentation
- create branches like `pure` `standard`, squash all the commits
- make a way to change shells (implement a javascript API for Zsh shell)
old todo:

- create `virkshop.appendToEnvVar`
    - will need a way to save/seralize data
        - add a hidden getter that maps to a json file inside of short term temp
    - create `setEnvVar()`
        - add a process as the very first .zsh script, have it be dynamically generated by a deno script
            - handle defining env vars
    - create `appendToEnvVar()`
    - create `prependToEnvVar()`
    - make those functions give an error if they're executed inside the Virkshop itself (or come up with a complex system of writing to another file and having zsh source that file after every execution)
- inline all the startup scripts
    - generate a single .zshrc file
    - for each .zsh file, inline it
    - for all other files, just try running them
- do custom work for the home mixin
    - notify user about potential conflicts
    - notify mixins if they attempt to use something like `.bashrc`
- create `addToGitignore()` function
- mixin tools
    - redo the startup message
    - have nix_tools use deno to link to the nix profile real-home, then 
    - fix git hooks
- figure out how to combine the nix file from individual mixins
- `triggerEvent()` function
- `wrapExecutable()` function for sudo, vim, and the like
- `appendToEnvVar()`
- `zshrc()`
- standardize and publish a deno FileSystem lib
- standardize and publish a deno Virkshop lib
- consider having a background deno task for faster execution times of scripts
- consider verifying the structure (broken links) as a background task after the shell starts
- make the nix install check faster
- make enter rewrite itself (and ignore changes) after a user successfully runs it once. Have the rewrite change the hashbang
